# Manticore Compiler

## TODO

### Width conversion with SRA, SLL, SRL:
1. Non-aligned shifting (width(rd) != width(rs))
2. Optimize constant shifting
3. Add unit tests for each case

### Test automation
1. Automate flow from Verilog


### Handling memory access in the interpreter
Use Memblock index to resolve abstract memory accesses in the interpreter Note that using the DebugSymbol index would not work because indices are only valid after width conversion and it would not work before  it



### Optimizing bad code
The following piece of code is generated by Thyrio and ca be
optimized out
```
.const c_1 1 1
.const c_0 1 0
.wire  cond 1
SEQ cond, _, _;
...
MUX cond_2, cond, c_0, c_1;

```
should coalesce cond_2 and cond
