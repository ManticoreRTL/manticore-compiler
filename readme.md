## TODO


### Optimizing bad code
The following piece of code is generated by Thyrio and ca be
optimized out
```
.const c_1 1 1
.const c_0 1 0
.wire  cond 1
SEQ cond, _, _;
...
MUX cond_2, cond, c_0, c_1;

```
should coalesce cond_2 and cond

## TEST TO ADD
Add a test to ensure that no memory address is truncated during width conversion
