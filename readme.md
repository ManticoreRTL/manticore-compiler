# Manticore Assembly Compiler

**This repository is under heavy development.**

Manticore is a massively parallel architecture for cycle-accurate RTL simulation
on FPGAs. The compiler takes an "unconstrained" assembly program written in
a single block of code and generates parallelized code for hardware execution.
